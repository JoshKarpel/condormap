v0.6.0
======

New Features/Improvements
-------------------------

* Add the ``shared`` delivery method, which supports HTCondor pools that use
  shared filesystems to make Python installations available universally.
  Issues: :issue:`195` and :issue:`198`
* Massive documentation upgrade courtesy of `Scott Sievert <https://github.com/stsievert>`_!
  Issues/PRs: :issue:`208`, :pr:`191`, and :pr:`202`
* The HTMap CLI (normally accessed by running ``htmap``) can now also be
  accessed by running ``python -m htmap``.
  Issue: :issue:`190`


Changed/Deprecated Features
---------------------------

* The HTMap CLI ``version`` command now also prints HTCondor Python bindings
  version information. Added ``htmap --version`` that only prints HTMap version
  information.


Bug Fixes
---------



Known Issues
------------

* HTMap does not currently allow "directory content transfers", which is an HTCondor
  feature where naming a directory in ``transfer_input_files`` with a trailing
  slash transfers the contents of the directory, not the directory itself.
  (If you try it, the directory itself will be transferred, as if you had not
  used a trailing slash).
  Issue: :issue:`215`
* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
  Issue: :issue:`129`
