v0.6.1
======

.. py:currentmodule:: htmap


This version is a drop-in replacement for v0.6.0, except that it relaxes the
version requirements for several dependencies to accommodate upcoming changes
to the
`pip dependency resolver <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/new-pip-resolver-to-roll-out-this-year.html>`_.


Known Issues
------------

* HTMap does not currently allow "directory content transfers", which is an HTCondor
  feature where naming a directory in ``transfer_input_files`` with a trailing
  slash transfers the contents of the directory, not the directory itself.
  (If you try it, the directory itself will be transferred, as if you had not
  used a trailing slash).
  Issue: :issue:`215`
* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
  Issue: :issue:`129`
